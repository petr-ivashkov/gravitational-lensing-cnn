# Recognition of strong gravitational lenses using convolutional neural network (CNN)

The project is carried out within the [university course at TUM](https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/org/cc/mh/PH0101/) under Stefan Recksiegel. In this work, a CNN to identify strong gravitational lenses is reproduced from [R. Canameras et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13048).

The model was trained and tested on a representative dataset. Further, the performance of the network was assessed, and improvement attempts were discussed. Finally, an approach to enforce the invariance of the network to 90â—¦ rotations of the input image was suggested and implemented.
